# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Node Progression System introduces dynamic difficulty scaling and cooldown mechanics to prevent quiz farming while maintaining user engagement. As users advance in rank/ELO, the content within nodes becomes more challenging, and completed nodes enter cooldown periods to encourage exploration of new material rather than repetitive grinding.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a learner, I want quiz difficulty to scale with my skill level, so that I'm always appropriately challenged and continue learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's rank increases THEN quiz content SHALL become more challenging
2. WHEN a user accesses a node THEN the system SHALL serve content appropriate to their current skill level
3. WHEN determining difficulty THEN the system SHALL consider user's ELO/LP rating
4. WHEN content scales THEN it SHALL maintain relevance to the core concept

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want completed nodes to have cooldowns, so that I'm encouraged to explore new topics rather than farming easy points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a quiz THEN the node SHALL enter a cooldown period
2. WHEN a node is on cooldown THEN the user SHALL NOT be able to retake the quiz immediately
3. WHEN cooldown expires THEN the user SHALL be able to access the node again
4. WHEN on cooldown THEN the system SHALL display remaining time clearly

*Note: This is a placeholder spec for future development. Implementation will come after core features are complete.*
