# Future Features Roadmap

## AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Expansion

### Phase 1: PDF Processing Infrastructure
- Extract text, figures, and equations from research papers
- Parse sections, abstracts, and references
- Store processed data in a structured format

### Phase 2: Knowledge Extraction System
- Develop AI system for:
  - Identifying key concepts and findings
  - Extracting relationships between concepts
  - Generating node metadata
  - Validating extracted information

### Phase 3: Graph Integration
- Automated node creation system
  - Generate new nodes from extracted knowledge
  - Establish connections with existing nodes
  - Apply color scheme rules for new nodes
  - Implement improved link weight balancing

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- Build validation tools:
  - Automated checks for data quality
  - Duplicate detection
  - Consistency verification
  - Human review interface
