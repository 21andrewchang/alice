# Landing Page – PRD (V1)

## Objective
Convert curious visitors into engaged onboarding users by communicating Alice’s value proposition quickly and clearly.

## Key Elements
1. Hero section with tagline: “Level-up your ML & Robotics skills—gamified.”
2. Animated demo GIF or Lottie of paper-to-lesson flow.
3. Primary CTA: “Start Learning Free” → `/onboarding` (guest mode).
4. Secondary CTA: “Login” for returning users (visible on scroll/sticky nav).
5. Social proof bar (e.g., “Used by founders from …”).
6. Lightweight FAQ accordion.

## Success Metrics
• Landing→onboarding click-through ≥ 60 %.  
• LCP < 2.5 s on mobile.  
• Bounce rate < 40 %.

## Non-Goals
• Blog / SEO content (Phase 2).  
• Pricing page (not needed yet).

## Future Considerations
• A/B test hero copy.  
• Add testimonials once we have early adopters.
