In today's video, I will explain you
Named Entity Recognition, with some
python coding.
You have seen this concept before in
this
NLP playlist. But let's go over it in
detail today.
So, I'm going to be explaining some real
life use cases of NER and, that way you
can understand this concept better. The
first one is search. Let's say you are on
any news website,
financial news website. They provide this
feature where you can type in
a company name. Let's say I want to
search for the news for Tesla.
When I click on it and scroll down,
I see the latest news on Tesla. And when
I go to any news, you will see this
tag you know, that for the news it it's
it knows that this is the news of
company Tesla.
Now CNBC editor might be putting this
tag explicitly. But I think the better
example is something like Google news,
where they are an aggregator website,
where
all they get is a text.
And based on the text,
you have to derive
the company that the news is about. So
essentially you're looking at the text
and in that text, you're trying to
extract companies, okay? What
which companies are mentioned in this
particular news article? So, here you see
it it is just tagging
Tesla as a company.
Now you might think, "Oh this is easy!" All
you can do is just search for company
Tesla or any other company, you can have
20 000 different companies and just
search for it.
But it might not be that straightforward
because,
Tesla could be a name of a person also.
You know Nikola Tesla a
genius
scientist.
So when I see a term tesla in any blog
or any article, I don't know if it's a
person or company. So that's when
the NER system
uh, can be useful, where the system
actually tells you what entity it is,
okay?
So NER is basically
Named Entity Recognization where
you try to extract different entities in
your in in your text. So here, Elon Musk
is a person, Tesla is a company.
There could be a location like New York,
India these are locations.
Money,
name of the drug, the entities could be
anything. So
when I have a lot of articles, let's say
you are building a website such as
Google news
and you have a lot of articles and you
don't know what entities are mentioned,
maybe you can use NER system and it will
extract all the entities. For example
see here
I have shown different examples right
where companies, products even look at
this example where the Pixel 7 is a
product. So the entity here is product.
Here there are two entities: Tesla and
Twitter. So if
you can extract these entities, then you
know in the CNBC example we saw, if
person can type in just a
name of the company, or name of the
product, we can show you all relevant
articles. So this is very useful
in case of search. The other use uh use
case is recommendation, which is
associated with the first use case we
which we already mentioned.
You might have seen on many website for
example on Bloomberg news, I see this
section where it says
Stories for You,
which means these are the stories
which they are showing based on my
preferences. This is a recommendation
system.
So here
let's say, I have read article about Elon
Musk or Hong Kong before,
then from that article let's say if the
entities are Elon Musk, location is Hong
Kong and if I like to read such an
article, it will
show me similar articles or having a
similar entity.
Uh, same like news. Uh not news, but the
movie recommendation system.
I have disney subscription and I like to
watch National Geographic um
documentaries.
So, here when you're looking at a
documentary
the entities could be,
who is the production house? Is it Marvel,
Pixar, National Geographic?
Who are the actors in the movie, right? So
these are
production house actors, these are
various entities. And if I have a
preference of watching movies from
certain actor or certain production
house,
then the recommendation system can
show me
the movies or documentaries from those
preferences.
The third use case is customer care
service.
I built this
website called codebasics.io for
it's it's a learning portal, basically.
And here is an awesome course, I have out
on
Power BI data analytics, and there is a
report issue button. So, if someone is
facing issue in my course they can
report an issue, okay?
Now see
this can be made simple by
right now, I know you're in Power BI course,
so I know actually that the issue is
related to Power BI. But let's say you
have a generic form,
where you can just type in text,
and I don't know what course you're
talking about, okay?
Then what happens like, how do I know
which course it is?
So when
you submit a query
from codebasics.io website,
in the backend,
I am getting these queries from many
people.
Well the reality is. we have not seen any
major issues so far. But let's say you're
talking about big system, where there are
multiple people,
uh filing multiple complaints.
And let's say you have
separate customer support team. Let's say
for Power BI course, I have
a separate team and for python course
there is another team, and they both
handle the queries related to that
course because they are trained to
answer the queries in that particular
course. Now if I can extract the entities,
which is a course, let's say
here course is my entity and if I can
extract the course name, then I can route
those issues to a relevant ticket. Now
you can have a drop down, simple drop
down in the contact us form, and you can
have user selected. But if you auto
detect that then it's, uh it looks nice
you know, so it's it's better,
all right? So, now let's
open Jupyter notebook, and write
code
in spacy, and we are going to use in
built NER system and then towards the
end, we'll talk about how you can build
your own uh NER system.
We will now explore
NER support in spacy. As usual I have
downloaded spacy's English model
and now,
I am going to look at
all the pipe names.
So this shows you the
the components in that NLP pipe
and we see a component called NER.
So, we'll see how this particular
component works.
You can have a statement like this:
Tesla is going to acquire twitter. It's
kind of dangling right now, I don't know
what's going to happen,
and if you want to look at all the
entities here, you can say for entity in
doc.entities So doc.entities
contains all the entities,
in this particular statement.
And then you can print
ent.text
so that is the label.
And just for a separator, I will use this
pipe operator,
and then you can print
ent.label
So this prints the actual label, whether
it's a company whatever.
And also I'm going to,
okay let me just try this first.
So it says Tesla incorporation is
organization, 45 billion is money.
And if you want to see
expanded version of this token,
you can use spacy.explain spacey.explain
and then give
label as an argument.
It says org means companies,
money means monetary value, etc.
You can use
displacy, we've used this before in our
tutorial,
displayc to
you know visually render the same thing
in a better way. So it's the same thing
but I am saying style is equal to ent
So displayc.render the document, and
the style I want is ent ent means
entities.
So when I do that see it says Tesla Inc
is org
and,
Twitter
uh 45 billion is money. Twitter it did
not recognize because, looks like spacy
is using
some kind of
rules or patterns, to recognize companies.
So if I say twitter.inc
that's a popular way of representing
companies in U.S. incorporation.
Okay, that did not work quite well. So now
you are realizing here
that,
okay let me try this.
See Twitter when I capitalized it, it
worked.
So, you are realizing that
uh the species out of the box
named entity recognization is not
perfect,
and that's perfectly fine.
It is using some kind of rules that if
there is a word
with first letter as capital, followed by
inc then that's a company.
All right, we'll look into
how you can build your own model little
later. But let's
first see what all
entities that spacy supports. We just
looked at org and money. If you
try this particular instruction,
it will print all the entities that spacy
supports
with that particular model, with this
particular
trained model, okay this model is a
pre-trained model and that supports
these many entities. So language, money
percentage, product, even
work of art and so on.
Let me try
different steps statement. I used to work
for Bloomberg and Bloomberg was a
company name, but Michael Bloomberg was a
person who founded that company.
So now, if you print the
entities, so I will just
use my most powerful weapon here,
which is ctrl c control v
and it says,
Michael Bloomberg is a person
[Music]
this is
now this is wrong, okay? Michael Bloomberg
this it should have
recognized, as a company. But bloomberg is
saying GPE.
If I do Bloomberg Inc maybe, it will work.
See now it says,
corporate company L.P.
Okay, yes.
This is funny, it's saying my Bloomberg
L.P is a person.
So you're seeing this is not perfect.
But it works on many cases. See, 1982 it
said it is a date.
So I want to try a different model, now.
So here in in Google,
you can say hugging face is a popular
machine learning NLP library and you can
say Hugging facee name entity
recognization.
And they have some
BERT based name entity recognization,
which you can try here. So here
see it is using this code, which is
hugging face. We use spacy but this
particular model is used for
three type of entities: location,
organization, person and miscellaneous.
Four entities.
And if you do compute,
Sara is a person, London is this.
You you can look at different examples
like, right like say this
see,
Clara lives in California. So, Berkeley,
California both of them it identified as
a location.
You can type your own thing as well. You
can say
Bloomberg
founded
Bloomberg
in 1980.
Now here again see this is making mistake.
But if I do
because Bloomberg both Bloomberg is saying
organization. The first one is actually
person. See now, Michael Bloomberg
is person.
So you're realizing that it depends on
how we have trained the model. When we
are using this ready-made spacy library,
we are using this this particular model
which is already trained, using bunch of
rules and vocabulary.
So you might want to set a custom entity.
For example
here,
in this
it is not recognizing Tesla or Twitter
as companies, okay?
And 45 billion is a money. So that's fine.
Now
what if
I want to add those twenties
specifically, I want to say
that, "hey spacy
these two are companies," okay? So you can
do that.
So let me first explain you a concept of
a span.
Span not spam.
So span,
is a class in spacy.
So when you are looking at, for example
when you're looking at, it any single
token, this is a single token,
and if you look at the type of this
it is a token.
But using Python's Slice Index Operator
let's say you say 2 to 5.
It is showing you a span
of tokens like a substring,
going to acquire. And the way it works is
it starts with index 2. So see 0 1 2. So
see going going
3 4
So it doesn't go all the way till 5,
it follows the usual Python convention.
So start with zero uh, start with 2 go
all the way till 5, but do not
include 5.
And if you look at the type,
see it is span,
not spam.
You can import
this span
class from spacy and what you can say
is my
t1
or let's say s1,
my first pen
from this document starting from 0 to 1.
So when I say 0 to 1 it is just one
token, which is Tesla,
okay? So in this doc object
0 to 1
which is Tesla, you're saying
it is org.
And similarly,
okay where is Twitter? So Twitter is 0
1 2 3 4 5
So 5 start from 5 go all the way
6, but do not include 6.
And those these two are my
my,
org
entities.
And there is a function on called set
ents So on the dock you can set set_ents
In the bracket,
specify all the entities that you want
to set. So s1 s2
and then say
default is equal to unmodified. So
default on whatever default entities are
there,
you keep them as is, and do not modify
them.
If you want to see your documentation
use your friend Google spacy
set
ents
shows you
a documentation, somewhere. I don't know
where.
But this Google is not recognizing it
properly.
So on the dock,
maybe set_ents this
okay?
How to set entity annotation for tokens
outside of any provided span? So you can
read through the description. But this
will basically
set those two entities.
So
unmodify, default isn't modified. Hold on.
There was a spelling mistake, and when I
print the same
entities again, now it is recognizing
Tesla and Twitter
as an organization, okay? So I can just
rewrite it again,
because there are t that that you know,
I fix the spelling for t.
Now,
I showed you how to
use spacy's inbuilt capabilities of NER.
But let's say you want to build your own
NER system, because we saw the the out of
the box NER system
has some bugs, some issues. Let's say you
are having a pharmaceutical
dataset, and you want to set entity for
a drug.
You need to do certain things, so that
you can train your own model. So I'm
going to go
very brief
into that. So how can I build my
own NER?
The first approach is simple lookup.
So this is not a some people say this is
not NLP. This is not.
This is a simple hard-coded approach. You
can have a database of companies,
location, drugs,
and as you get more companies or
locations or drugs in your vocabulary,
you have a process where
a an operator manually adds that entity
into these databases.
And when you look at the tax and
tokenize it, you do comparison. It's like
a very stupid, very naive approach. But it
works.
So some folks use this simple lookup and
you know, as long as it works, you don't
need to have unnecessary emotional
attachment for NLP or machine learning.
Depends on your use case. Maybe for your
use case simple look lookup is the best
idea.
The second approach is Rule Based NER
and we saw already in spacy that it was
using some rule, that if there is a
word followed by inc
,and the first letter of the word is
capital, that is a company.
Similarly,
let's say if there is a statement like
this: Thor was born in 1865. However, I
don't know the real birth date of Thor,
then you can say if you find this kind
of pattern was born in something, and
before was, if there is a proper noun we
looked at
POS before, so if you're not seen that
video, go check it out.
So if that is a proper noun, then that
token
is
person.
You can have that kind of rule.
You can have a rule for phone numbers.
For phone number best thing is regular
expression, regex. We have covered regex
in in this tutorial playlist.
So regex
or any other rules.
But there are basically rule based NER
and spacy provides a class called
EntityRuler.
That can be used
to write or specify
all these rules,
okay?
And I found this
nice article,
which I'm going to show you guys.
So the article description is there.
Article link is there in the description.
So see, here to recognize
phone number,
you can use entity ruler class and you
can specify
your pattern like this. This is just a
syntax that you can use to specify that
pattern,
and when you do that see it says phone
number. This is a phone number.
I'm not covering this because this is
just the basics of NER. In the future
maybe we will build our own
NER system. I'm thinking of building a
resume parser as a
as a, project. So in the future we will
have end-to-end NLP project in this
playlist,
where we we will use NER
and spacy to custom train our model. But
yeah, the third approach is machine
learning, where you can use a technique
called Conditional Random Fields.
Now I know I don't
like to use jargons,
and I'm throwing jargon at you don't.
Don't worry just keep this thing in your
mind that, CRF is something that can be
used
for
NER machine learning
model and BERT is another popular
approach.
That's all I had for this tutorial.
The link for the code is in the video
description below. I did not get a chance
to
create exercises
for this video. But sometimes when I find
a time later on, I put exercises. So
always check video description.
Maybe I'll add some exercises at a later
stage. And if you want to help me, what
you can do is you can go to my GitHub.
Create your exercise, for the repo. Create
an exercise give me a pull request,
and if your pull request gets merged, you
know the whole world benefits. Not the
whole world, but at least the people who
are watching this video and who wants to
work on exercise,
will benefit. And I will give you all the
due credits.
I hope you like this video. If you did
please give it a thumbs up and share it
with your friends. Sharing on LinkedIn is
a very effective way of sharing good
resources, that you're finding. I see
some of my subscribers are doing that,
that if they find,
not only my video, but any other video on
YouTube
which they find it useful they share it
on Linkedin, and kind of helps spread the
