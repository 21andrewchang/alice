Today we will discuss an important
concept called stop words in NLP.
Let's look at our same example, that we
discussed in last video, which is you
have news articles, and you want to
tag or auto tag the company name. And how
do you do that? Well
when you are reading the article, you
notice certain words such as Elon Musk,
gigafactory, model 3. If you encounter
those words you know this is Tesla.
If you encounter Apple,
iPhone, those kind of words you know that
the news article is about Apple, and this
is a classic problem that they saw
in NLP world,
where they try to auto extract entity or
they try to tag the topics to a news
article.
And this approach is called bag of
words which is something we already
discussed in the last video,
where
let's say you have three articles, you
don't know which company
the article is from,
and if you can build simple
bag of words model, where bag of words
is a jargon. It's it's very simple thing
actually. You have a word and you count
number of words. So in first article
Tesla appears 14 times, model 3 appears
9 times, and it's obvious this is
a Tesla company right? And based on see
the the second article iPhone appeared
13 times, iPad appears 6 times, and
remaining words are 0, etc., You know it
is about Apple.
But if you read the article carefully
you will find
a lot of other words as well such as
wants, time, to prepare. So see I
represented a very simple
model here. You know very convenient
model. In reality you will have
lot of noise.
You will have too, far, over and these
words are general English words, which
can appear in any article with a equal
frequency. Based on these word count, you
can't determine if the article is from
Tesla or Apple.
Wouldn't it be nice if you can filter
these words? So let's say, I'm looking at
this article
and some common words which appear in
pretty much all the articles, like to,
from, the, a and over. If you can remove
that,
you can make
your bag of words model little less
sparse. So sparse means, in this model you
have a lot of noise,
the vocabulary is very big, computation
time is high, it's a sparse model.
Whereas if you remove these words,
your model will get simpler and you will
be focusing on things that you care
about,
okay? So if you have this kind of model,
it's better.
So these words are called stop words, and
it's a common practice that during
pre-processing stage in NLP pipeline,
majority of the time they remove stop
words.
Now there are certain occasions,
where they don't remove it and we'll
look into that.
For example,
let's say you have you're doing
sentiment classification and
you have this is a good movie, this is
not a good movie. But when you remove
stop words, what you will get as a result
is good movie, good movie. This might be
little,
you know incorrect,
because not, not
is a stop word. So if you remove that,
and if you process remaining sentence,
you can run into issue. However uh for
sentiment classification, you will see
things like this is the worst movie okay?
There are some people who will say this
is not a good movie. But majority of the
time, this problem doesn't arise. But I
want to just tell you so that you keep
this thing in mind, just in case you're
using stop words and you're not getting
expected results for your NLP
application.
When you're doing language translation,
let's say how are you doing Dhaval,
translate that into Telugu
if I remove stop words in the
pre-processing stage,
all I will get is Dhaval, and you can't
translate Dhaval to Telugu by keeping
the meaning of original sentence same.
So
you have to use common sense and look at
a given NLP problem, it's a machine
translation, it's a sentiment
classification, what kind of problem it
is? And based on that you use
stop words
removal technique during pre-processing
stage. Stop word removal is actually
common in many applications, but
applications like this machine
translation, another one is
uh chatbot,
right? Someone is asking a question, "I
don't find a yoga mat on your website.
Can you help?" If you remove stop words in
pre-processing phase,
all you get is fine, yoga, mat, website,
help.
What does that mean? You know it doesn't
capture the essence of the questions in
a right way? So these are some of the
examples where you have to be careful
about
not removing the stop words. But in
majority of the other cases,
removing stop words during
pre-processing stage is a common
practice. Let's do some coding now.
As usual I have created a new notebook,
imported spaCy, and by doing this from
spacey.
lang.
en.stop words
import stopwords you can you can look at
all the stop words which are there in
this English model.
So you see that a,
all, alone,
back, cannot,
these are commonly used terms in English,
and removing them
prior to building your actual model will
give you a lot of benefit. And
there are 326
of them in total.
Now let me create a new doc
in our usual style, and see how this
thing works. So
I will just
create
simple
document here,
and then you can go
token by token. So from for token in doc
and there is this method called
is stop So this will tell you if
the given token is a stop word or not.
And if you print
that token,
see these are all the stop words,
and what people do is, they define
uh some function called let's say
preprocess,
where you give our text as an input and
this is a common practice in NLP
application,
and you want to do all preprocessing
here. So pre-processing means removing
stop words, stemming, lemmatization and
things like that.
So here,
I will say doc is equal to
nlp text
for
token
in dock
if
token.
is stop
you know what I'll do, I will remove it.
So if you want to remove it you'll say,
if not token So that's a reverse. If it is
not a stop word,
then
maybe store this in some kind of array
okay? And
the better way of doing this in Python
is using list comprehension.
So I will say
here I want to use list comprehension,
and I will say no stop words,
and that is equal to
see you get your for loop here first,
and before the for loop, you will say
token.txt so token.txt is what you want
in this list as a final thing and your if
condition, you specify here.
This is how you write
the
list comprehension,
okay? And you can return
no stop words
and then
I can
do pre-processing
of this text,
and it will print me
all the tokens, just by skipping
this thing.
Uh the stop words. Now see you can have
things like comma, so you can remove that
as well
by saying
and not token.is there is a
punctuation mark right? This is a
punctuation mark. I don't want to
care about punctuation mark, and it will
remove that. See there was a comma
punctuation mark which got removed.
So
we can try a few other statements. For
example I
my most favorite one is this.
You see the other, is not, these were all
stopp words and it removed that.
Checking our article on Tesla right, you
you can have this big sentence. But when
you remove stop words, you want only the
terms that you care about which is Musk,
wants, time, prepare I know some of these
are not even useful wants, etc. but that's
okay. At least we removed the most common
ones.
Now how do we apply this preprocessing
function
on a pandas data frame? Let's say
one of the common use case in machine
learning is you load your data in pandas
data frame, and then you want to build
NLP model. Now you want to do
pre-processing on top of it. So
what I'm going to do here
is,
I have taken this particular dataset. So
let me show you,
so these are all the cases
in department of justice U.S.A from 2009
to 2018.
These are all the press releases okay?
And the database is in json format.
So see there is some court case. So it's
basically press release of some court
case, the
the verdict that court gave and so on.
And these are the content of the case.
This is a title, things like that.
So I had taken this data set from kaggle,
and I have placed
a,
I have downloaded that json file,
and then that json file, I am going to
import in pandas by doing this.
If you don't know pandas, in YouTube
search Codebasics pandas you will find
my tutorials.
So here when you say lines true,
there is one line
for one json object okay? When you load
this,
what you will find is
13,000 records basically.
And let me print first 5 records.
So see these are all the cases, and what
I have is case ID, the title, the actual
content, big press release date,
and the topics. Now some of the topics
are empty.
So let's say I'm building a model to
auto extract topics, that's my NLP
application that I'm building.
I can filter all the articles which
don't have any topic
okay? And the way you do that is,
see the type of this df.topics if you
look at df.topics0 for example
right,
the type
of this thing
is
list
okay? So df.info if you do df.info
it will also
tell you a few things.
df. these are all the exploratory
methods
that you use
to kind of go over it. But anyways we
know that
the topics type is list, and you want to
filter it. So how do you filter it? So you
might have seen this in my pandas
tutorial, that you can
use your filtering condition here in
this this square bracket. So you can say
df is equal to filtering condition that
you specify in this bracket. And what is
my filtering condition? So you can say
df.topics okay.
So let's see. I want to say
whenever df.topics
is an empty list
okay, filter that.
And one way of doing this could be okay,
you write maybe some lambda function. You
check the length of the list, or
there is an easier way, which is
you convert this to str
and you check the length. This is a
ready-made function that pandas provide,
and whenever this length is not 0,
which means list has some content you
get that.
So now when you do df.head first
5
see,
you have filtered all those rows which
had empty
list in our topics.
And then
uh your pandas
data frame is only 4,000
rows. Initially it was 13,000 rows. So
by the way
by doing this exercise,
uh I I'm just showing you how would you
apply stop word removal,
when you're dealing with a real database
okay? So this preprocessing function is
kind of a simple function that works
fine on one string. But usually when you
are doing any, building any NLP
application, many cases you will have
pandas data frame. So I just want to
demonstrate, we are not going to build
any machine learning model in this
tutorial. I just want to demonstrate how
you apply pre-processing function on a
pandas column,
and to keep things simple and fast, I
will just take first 100 rows of
my data frame.
Only first 100 because I want to
show pre-processing, and I can do it on a
smaller data set right?
And now when I do df.shape only 100
rows okay?
And
now
on the content see,
I have this
contents right, this contents.
If you look at this contents
it is this
and this is the ID. So let's say 4 is
the ID. So if you do iloc 4
you'll be able to print, see this big
paragraph, and this big big paragraph
look at the length.
And what I want to do is, I want to
remove all the stop words from this, so
that this length can be reduced, and I
can build
effective, simple, NLP application out of
this okay? So let's
remove
stop words
from this column, from this entire column,
stop words I want to remove right? So
like for, the see all these stop words.
In pandas so I will do let's say, I will
create,
I want to maintain that column and I
want to create a new column called
contents new,
and you all know,
if you have an existing column
you can use apply function
to create a new column, and on this
existing column, I want to apply my
pre-process function,
because preprocess function is already
defined you see.
And by the way
I don't want
array to be back. I want the string to be
back. So if you want to convert this
list or array into string
in Python, you just do simply join.
So when you do this join, it will take
all the list elements and create a
string out of it. Right now you're
getting a list, you will get now a string,
see.
So that's the effect of doing this. So my
preprocess function now takes input
string, remove all the stop words, returns
another string,
and when I do that that's what is gonna
happen,
and I can print the first
5 elements.
Based on your
computer and the size data size, it may
take time. We have only 100 elements, so
it came back pretty fast, and you see
this new contents new.
And you will see things like see here it
says 130 count criminal incident was
you see, was released. So see here was is
removed,
and if you want to see it
a little further,
what you can do is,
see this length was
5504. But if you look at new content,
see 4217.
So 5504 - 4217
where stopwatch it removed all
of them. And if you want to print these
things,
let's print it.
So contents new is after removing your
stop words. So now see what you have is
21st, let me just print you know first
300 character or so so that is readable.
So see 21st century end, so see end is
removed,
off, off is gone, it is gone
agreed, affiliates, all these things are
gone.
Hurrah! You just wrote a function to
remove stop words, and also, you did this
thing in pandas data frame.
So that's all I have for this video.
Keep on checking video description folks,
because
many times I add exercise after one or
two week of publishing the video.
Sometimes I add it later also. This is a
community effort. For example
see let me just show you,
Codebasics NLP.
When I was
doing this video I did not have the
exercise okay? But later on Kiran Marala,
he's a community contributor, he helped
me build this exercise. So now there is
this exercise for bag of words,
and there is exercise solution also. So
you can look at the solution. But I know
you all are sincere students, you will
not look at the solution unless you have
tried it on your own.
So for today's video also
uh
if you want to contribute just
uh,
fork the GitHub repo, and make changes, and
give me a pull request. I will look into
it. But yes my idea is to have exercises
available for all the videos, at some
point of time, if not at the time of
publishing. I wish you all the best! Thank
you for watching!
