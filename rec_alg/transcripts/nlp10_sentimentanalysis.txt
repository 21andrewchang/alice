Ever wondered how companies know what you think about them?
Well, they can't read minds,
but they can read your tweets, emails, reviews,
and pretty much everything else you write online.
And this is where sentiment analysis comes in.
Sentiment analysis involves analyzing large volumes of text
to determine the sentiment expressed,
to see if it's positive or negative,
or somewhere in between, like neutral.
And it's intended to help companies better understand their customers,
to deliver stronger customer experiences and improve their brand reputation.
But it's not without its pitfalls.
Okay, so let's get into this.
And sentiment analysis is built on top of something called NLP,
Natural Language Processing,
to train software to analyze and interpret text
in a way that mimics human understanding.
And there are a couple of main approaches to this.
There's rule-based and then there's machine learning based.
And then sometimes you'll see a hybrid of the two.
And let's start with rule-based.
So what about the rule-based approach to sentiment analysis.
Well in this approach software is trained to
classify certain keywords in a block of text
based on groups of words, or what are called "lexicons".
And lexicons are groupings of words that describe the author's intent.
So, for example, let's consider some lexicons.
So, "affordable" would be one,
"well made" would be another one.
Perhaps we might consider "fast" as another lexicon.
What do they all have in common?
Well, they would all be in the positive lexicon.
So we can give this a big, happy smiley face.
But then we could say things like "expensive"
or we could say "poorly made", or we could say "slow".
And yes, clearly these would all be considered the sad face.
These would be considered negative lexicons.
Now the software scans the text for these keywords,
and then calculates a sentiment score based
on the frequency in the context of these words.
So if we look at this review here that says,
"these shoes are affordable, well made and shipping was fast".
Well, that scores highly in the positive lexicon
and can be considered an overall positive sentiment.
Boy, this is easy.
There is no way the nuances of human language will ever get in the way of us assigning sentiment scores, right?
Well, that that is a fine example of sarcasm,
and sarcasm can really trip up sentiment analysis systems.
It can be a real problem, especially for the rule-based approach to sentiment analysis.
So consider this review: "Oh, wonderful."
"A pair of shoes so well-made they lasted me one full week.".
A rule based system might pick up on "wonderful" and "well-made"
as being in the positive lexicon category,
and then misclassify the overall sentiment as positive, missing the sarcastic tone entirely.
But sarcasm?
That's just one example.
Another one is negation.
Now negation can really trip these things up as well.
If we take the sentence:
"I wouldn't say the shoes were inexpensive".
Well, the word inexpensive, that might typically signal a positive sentiment in the lexicon,
but here it's used in a negated form to imply the shoes are actually a little bit expensive.
So without understanding the context, a rules-based system might misinterpret the sentiment.
And then there's also idiomatic language
which can trip things up as well.
So if we think about phrases like "break a leg", or
"it's a piece of cake",
they don't literally mean what the words suggest.
So if somebody writes, "At this price, the shoes are a steal".
A rule-based system might incorrectly assume theft
based on negativity, instead of understanding
that it means the shoes were a great bargain.
Okay, so what about the other type of approach.
And that is the machine learning.
The machine learning approach to sentiment analysis.
Now, that helps tackle some of these issues by training algorithms
on large data sets to recognize patterns, including the complexities of human language.
And developers use sentiment analysis algorithms
to teach software how to identify emotion in text
simply the same way that humans do.
Now that's performed, typically using classification algorithms.
And let's take a look at a couple of classification algorithms now.
So we'll start with the first one which is called linear regression.
And linear regression is a pretty
common classification algorithm that, in this case,
predicts a sentiment score based on various features in the text.
So, for example, to determine the sentiment of product reviews,
it considers the frequency of positive and negative words,
but also the review length and specific emotive phrases.
Another one we can use is Naive Bayes,
and this uses Bayes' theorem
to classify text by calculating the probability of a sentiment
based on word occurrences.
So, for instance, if we have a dataset of restaurant reviews already labeled as positive or negative,
then this algorithm calculates the likelihood
that a new review is positive or negative
based on the words it contains.
And another one is SVM, that is Support Vector Machines,
and they're are fast and effective classification algorithm
used to solve two group classification problems.
So to classify customer reviews as positive or negative,
SVM identifies the optimal boundary that separates the two groups,
and it does that by analyzing features like word frequencies and phrases,
ensuring the maximum margin between the positive and the negative reviews.
Now, together, these approaches can help weed out
the sarcasm, negation, and idiomatic language
expressed in human generated text.
All right. Now, depending on their needs,
organizations can use various types of sentiment analysis
to get a clearer picture of customer sentiments.
And we're going to look at a few types.
And they all rely on the software's ability to gauge something
that is known as polarity.
Now polarity is the the the overall feeling conveyed by a piece of text.
And it can be generally described on a scale.
So we have positive at one end, neutral in the middle.
And negative at the other end.
And then some models take it even further,
categorizing text into subcategories like
extremely positive and extremely negative.
So we have a scale here that we can rank things on.
All right. So let's consider a few of these.
And we're going to start with "fine-grained".
So this is a type of sentiment analysis also known as "graded",
and sentiment analysis groups text into different emotions here
and the level of emotion being expressed.
So polarity here actually is often expresses a numerical rating
on a scale of 0 to 100, where zero is neutral
and then 100 represents the most extreme sentiment.
There's also also aspect-based sentiment analysis.
So ABSA.
And that narrows the focus to specific aspects of a product, or of a service or of a customer experience.
So, for example, like a budget travel app might use ABSA
to analyze user feedback specifically about its new customer chatbot.
This helps businesses understand precisely what customers like
or dislike about particular features,
allowing them to address those specific issues.
And there's also emotional detection
as a different type of sentiment analysis,
and this seeks to understand the psychological state
that the individual behind the body of text,
including their frame of mind when they were writing it
and their intentions.
It's more complex than either fine-grained or ABSA,
and it's typically used to gain a deeper understanding
of a person's motivation or their emotional state.
So, for example, a support ticket saying something like,
"I'm extremely frustrated by the repeated issues".
I mean, that reveals not just negative sentiment,
but it also reveals the specific emotion of frustration.
So, rather than using polarities like positive, negative, or neutral,
emotional detection can identify specific emotions in a body of text.
The core idea here is that by building an understanding of sentiment
as it relates to a customer's overall experience,
specific features, and underlying emotion,
an organization will be empowered to make meaningful changes.
Say, for example, to learn which issues to escalate in a support forum,
or to conduct market research on competitors
to spot trends and identify new opportunities.
Ultimately, sentiment analysis is a tool to extract meaningful analysis to guide business decisions.
When done right, sentiment analysis can walk the line of human nuance,
turning even the trickiest reviews,
yeah, even the most sarcastic ones,
into clear insights.
