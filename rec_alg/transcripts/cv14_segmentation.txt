let's learn four concepts today
image segmentation semantic segmentation
instant segmentation and panoptic
segmentation
image segmentation refers to dividing
the image into groups of pixels based on
some criteria
a segmentation algorithm
takes an image as input and outputs a
collection of regions or segments
you can represent these regions as
contours or as masks
the mask representation is much more
common these days
we assign a different grayscale value to
differentiate between different segments
in this representation
often we use pseudo coloring to color
these segments for better visualization
now let's see what is semantic
segmentation
in semantic segmentation the goal is to
assign a label like car building person
road etc to every pixel in the image
here is an example of semantic
segmentation
the red color represents the person
light green is the grass class
dark green represents the tree class and
blue shows the sky class
you can see which pixels belong to the
person class by simply checking if the
mask color is red at that pixel
but we cannot say if two red colored
pixels belong to the same person or
different ones
we just know that red means it belongs
to the person class
but what if we want to differentiate
between instances of the same class we
want to say these group of pixels belong
to person one and these other group of
pixels belong to person two
they both belong to the person class but
we want to differentiate between
instances of the same class person one
and person two
well in such cases we use instant
segmentation which is closely related to
object detection
however unlike object detection the
output is a mask or contour containing
the object instead of a bounding box
unlike semantic segmentation
usually we do not label every pixel in
the image we are only interested in
finding the
boundaries of specific objects
we see the mask for every person has a
different color so we can tell them
apart
however not every pixel has a class
label associated with it
i know what you're thinking now
can we combine
semantic segmentation with instance
segmentation
and get the best of both the worlds
fortunately there is a class of
techniques which does exactly this
and that's called panoptic segmentation
every pixel is assigned a class
but if there are multiple instances of a
class we know which pixel belong to
which instance of the class it combines
the goodies from both semantic
segmentation as well as
instant segmentation
every pixel has a different color-coded
label for example
the sky in this example is blue the
trees are dark green the grass is light
green
and people are colored in different
yellow red and purple shades so whenever
we see something yellow red or purple we
can say that it is a person but at the
same time we can also say that it is
person one versus person two versus
person three etc
the colors yellow and red both point to
the same class person
but to different instances of this class
we can tell different people apart by
just looking at the mask color
so to summarize
in image segmentation our goal is to
divide the image into different regions
semantic segmentation is a kind of image
segmentation where every pixel is
assigned a class label
instant segmentation is like object
detection but instead of finding
bounding box around the object we find
the precise mask for the objects in the
image panoptix segmentation combines
semantic segmentation with instant
segmentation

state-of-the-art algorithms for each
type of segmentation in the description
