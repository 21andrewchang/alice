## Risk Mitigation Timeline

### Critical Path Risks
1. **Epic 1 delay**: Core platform must be solid foundation
   - Mitigation: Start immediately, allocate extra time if needed
2. **Alice integration complexity**: AI features are technically challenging
   - Mitigation: Start with simple manual system, automate later
3. **Payment processing issues**: Technical integration challenges
   - Mitigation: Use proven solutions (Stripe), start integration early

### Scope Management
- **Must-Have**: Epics 1-5 for basic monetization
- **Nice-to-Have**: Epic 6 advanced features can be post-launch
- **Polish**: Epic 7 only if timeline allows

### Success Metrics by Week
- **Week 3**: 100 engaged alpha users
- **Week 5**: 1,000 total users, viral sharing active
- **Week 7**: First paying customers
- **Week 9**: 100+ paying users, $1K+ MRR

This aggressive timeline requires focused execution and willingness to cut scope if needed. The priority is shipping a monetizing product by Nov 1, not building the perfect platform.
