# MVP Alpha Task List

GOAL: Given an input subject, give an immediate high-level view.
Give the user the entire scope of a field so they are well prepared.
Give a tool to easily navigate that huge scope so they aren't overwhelmed.
Help the user navigate based on their strengths and their interests. (curiosity)

- Force-Directed Graph View  
  - Renders all nodes/edges on `/` via D3 or vis-network.

- JSON Input Form  
  - Single textarea to paste JSON of the shape:
    {
      "label": "NodeLabel",
      "edges": [
        { "target": "OtherNode", "relation": "prerequisite" },
        { "target": "ThirdNode",  "relation": "lateral"  }
      ]
    }
  - On submit:
    - If `NodeLabel` doesn’t exist, create it.
    - For each edge, if `target` node doesn’t exist, create it.
    - Create the edge with `source = NodeLabel`.

- API Endpoints  
  - `GET /api/graph` → `{ nodes: [...], edges: [...] }`  
  - `POST /api/graph` → accepts the above JSON
    - upserts nodes & edges, returns updated graph.

- Database Storage  
  - Persistent store (e.g. SQLite via Prisma, JSON file, or Supabase).  
  - Tables/collections:
    - `nodes(id, label)`  
    - `edges(id, source_id, target_id, relation)`

- Dynamic Node Page  
  - Route `/node/[label]` displays that node’s label and its direct neighbors.

- Live Updates  
  - After any `POST /api/graph`, re-fetch `/api/graph` and re-render the graph.

- SvelteKit Routing & Setup  
  - `/+page.svelte` for main graph + JSON form  
  - `/node/[label]/+page.svelte` for node detail  
  - `/api/graph/+server.js` handles both GET and POST  
  - DB connection logic in a shared `lib/db.js`
