# Nexus Development Roadmap Status

**Last Updated**: December 26, 2024  
**Target**: 100+ paying users by November 1, 2024 for YC application

## Epic Progress Overview

### ‚úÖ Epic 1: Core Platform (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: Fully implemented and working
- **Stories**: Graph visualization, force simulation, domain-based colors, animations
- **Outcome**: Beautiful, smooth force-directed graph with shooting star effects

### ‚úÖ Epic 2: Graph Interactions (COMPLETED)  
- **Status**: Fully implemented and working
- **Stories**: Hover tooltips, click details, zoom/pan/drag, PDF viewer integration
- **Outcome**: Intuitive graph exploration with rich node details

### üöß Epic 3: Data Architecture & Content Loading (MOSTLY COMPLETE)
- **Status**: 80% complete - CRITICAL BLOCKER IDENTIFIED
- **Stories Completed**:
  - ‚úÖ JSON Data Structure (rich metadata, domains, validation)
  - ‚úÖ Content Loading System (dynamic loading, performance optimization)
- **BLOCKING STORY**: 
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Story 3.3: Seed Network Population** - HIGH PRIORITY
  - **Issue**: We have small demo network, need to populate with rich CV/NLP content
  - **Action Needed**: Build content processing pipeline for `rec_alg/transcripts/`

### üîÑ Epic 4: Content Expansion System (BLOCKED)
- **Status**: Blocked by Epic 3, Story 3.3
- **Cannot proceed** until seed network is populated
- **Stories**: Local content directory system, multi-domain expansion

## üö® CURRENT HIGH PRIORITY FOCUS

### **Epic 3, Story 3.3: Seed Network Population**
**This is the critical blocker preventing Nexus from becoming a genuinely useful learning platform.**

#### What We Have:
- Small demo network (6 nodes: believable acting paper + math prerequisites)
- Rich existing content in `rec_alg/transcripts/` (CV and NLP domains)
- Beautiful graph visualization that can handle 100+ nodes

#### What We Need:
1. **Content Processing Pipeline**: Convert transcript files to graph JSON
2. **CV Domain Network**: ~25-30 nodes from computer vision transcripts  
3. **NLP Domain Network**: ~25-30 nodes from NLP transcripts
4. **Cross-Domain Connections**: Math prerequisites connecting to both domains
5. **Performance Testing**: Ensure smooth interactions with 50-100 nodes

#### Expected Outcome:
- Transform from 6-node demo to 50-100 node learning platform
- Multiple learning domains with rich content
- Real learning paths users can follow
- Foundation for Epic 4 content expansion

## üî• High Priority TODOs
1. **Force-Directed Graph Link Weight Balancing** (visual UX issue)
2. **Complete Story 3.3: Seed Network Population** (critical blocker)

## Next Steps Roadmap

### Immediate (1-2 days)
- **Focus**: Complete Epic 3, Story 3.3
- **Build**: Content processing pipeline
- **Populate**: CV and NLP domain networks
- **Test**: Performance with larger network

### Week 2
- **Epic 4**: Content Expansion System (unblocked)
- **Epic 5**: Enhanced Node Details  
- **Epic 6**: Search & Alice MVP

### Week 3-4  
- **Epic 7**: User Authentication
- **Epic 8**: Progress Tracking
- **Epic 9**: Basic Gamification

### Week 4-7 (Beta Release)
- **Epic 10**: User Profiles & Social
- **Epic 11**: Viral Sharing System
- **Epic 12**: Second Domain Addition

## Success Metrics
- **Current**: 6 nodes in demo network
- **Target Epic 3**: 50-100 nodes across 3+ domains
- **Target Alpha**: Engaging learning experience with multiple paths
- **Target Beta**: 100+ engaged users with social features
- **Target Launch**: 100+ paying customers

## Key Decision Points
1. **Content Quality**: Ensure CV/NLP networks provide genuine learning value
2. **Performance**: Maintain 60fps with larger networks
3. **User Experience**: Learning paths should feel natural and progressive
4. **Domain Connections**: Smart cross-domain prerequisites (math ‚Üí CV/NLP)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risk**: Graph performance with 100+ nodes (can test incrementally)
- **Content Risk**: Quality of auto-generated networks (manual validation needed)  
- **Timeline Risk**: Content processing may take longer than expected (start simple)
- **User Risk**: Large networks may feel overwhelming (need good navigation)

---

**BOTTOM LINE**: Epic 3, Story 3.3 is the critical path. Everything else is blocked until we populate the seed network and transform Nexus from demo to genuinely useful learning platform.
