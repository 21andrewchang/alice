# Epic 4: Content Expansion System

**Timeline**: 4-5 days (Week 2)  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Path  
**Status**: üöß **IN PROGRESS** (Story 3.3 from Epic 3 is blocking)

## Epic Goal
Build a robust content expansion system that allows easy addition of new learning materials, making Nexus grow from a demo into a genuinely useful learning platform with multiple knowledge domains.

## **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
Epic 4 is blocked by **Story 3.3: Seed Network Population** from Epic 3. We need to complete the data collection system and populate the initial seed network before expanding the content system further.

## **CURRENT HIGH PRIORITY**
**Complete Epic 3, Story 3.3 FIRST**: Build content processing pipeline to convert existing `rec_alg/transcripts/` to graph JSON and create the initial multi-domain network.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Local directory system for adding new content (PDFs, transcripts, etc.)
- [ ] Automatic node generation from content files
- [ ] Multiple knowledge domains beyond just "believable acting"
- [ ] Clean content organization and categorization
- [ ] Smooth integration with existing graph visualization
- [ ] Support for different content types (research papers, tutorials, etc.)
- [ ] Easy content discovery and navigation

## High Priority Tasks
- [ ] **Content Ingestion Pipeline**: System to process local content files
- [ ] **Multi-Domain Support**: Add CS, ML, and other learning domains
- [ ] **Node Generation**: Automatic creation of graph nodes from content
- [ ] **Content Categorization**: Smart domain and type classification
- [ ] **File Management**: Organized structure for content storage

## **FUTURE VISION** 
*The end goal is an AI agent that automatically scrapes research papers, processes information, creates nodes, and connects them appropriately - creating a self-growing, always-current learning network.*

## Stories

### Story 4.1: Local Content Directory System (2 days)
**Goal**: Organized file structure for easy content addition

**User Story**: As a content creator, I want to easily add new learning materials by dropping files in organized directories, so that expanding the knowledge graph doesn't require code changes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Structured directory system for different domains (CS, ML, research, etc.)
- [ ] Support for PDF files and metadata
- [ ] Automatic file discovery and indexing
- [ ] Content validation and error handling
- [ ] Integration with existing graph data structure

### Story 4.2: Multi-Domain Knowledge Expansion (2-3 days)
**Goal**: Add multiple learning domains beyond current content

**User Story**: As a learner, I want to explore different knowledge domains (Computer Science, Machine Learning, etc.) so that I can learn across multiple fields within the same platform.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add Computer Science fundamentals domain
- [ ] Add Machine Learning/AI domain
- [ ] Add Mathematics domain
- [ ] Each domain has distinct visual identity in graph
- [ ] Cross-domain connections where appropriate
- [ ] Domain filtering and navigation options

## Technical Architecture
- **Content Storage**: Local file system with organized directories
- **File Processing**: Automatic metadata extraction and node generation
- **Graph Integration**: Seamless addition to existing D3 visualization
- **Scalability**: Structure ready for future database migration

## Dependencies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKING**: Epic 3, Story 3.3 (Seed Network Population) must complete first
- Completed Epic 1 (graph visualization)
- Completed Epic 2 (graph interactions)
- Content organization from existing rec_alg transcripts
- PDF handling capabilities

## Success Metrics
- **Content Volume**: 50+ nodes across 3+ domains
- **User Engagement**: Multiple learning paths available
- **Expansion Rate**: New content can be added in minutes, not hours
- **Domain Coverage**: CS, ML, Math basics covered

## Notes
- **Philosophy**: Make content expansion trivial for rapid growth
- **Focus**: Quality content organization over complex features
- **Goal**: Transform Nexus from demo to genuinely useful learning tool
- **Vision**: Foundation for future AI-powered content expansion
