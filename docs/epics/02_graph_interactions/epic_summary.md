- ✅ Click nodes for expanded details view
- ✅ Zoom, pan, and drag functionality
- ✅ Node scaling on hover for feedback
- ✅ Smart tooltip vs label system based on zoom level
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Touch controls compatibility

## Stories

### Story 2.1: Node Details System ✅
**Goal**: Provide detailed information about nodes through interactions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Hover tooltips showing node labels
- ✅ Click nodes to open detailed side panel
- ✅ PDF viewer integration for research papers
- ✅ Zoom controls for PDF viewing
- ✅ Clean panel animations and transitions

### Story 2.2: Graph Navigation Controls ✅
**Goal**: Intuitive graph exploration and navigation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Zoom functionality with mouse wheel and buttons
- ✅ Pan by dragging background
- ✅ Drag individual nodes
- ✅ Programmatic zoom and center on node click
- ✅ Smart positioning (25% from left when side panel open)
- ✅ Smooth 750ms zoom transitions

## Technical Implementation
- **D3 Zoom Behavior**: Full zoom, pan, drag support
- **Tooltip System**: Conditional display based on zoom level
- **Side Panel**: Containerized node details with PDF embedding
