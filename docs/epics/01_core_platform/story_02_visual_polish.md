# Story 1.2: Visual Polish & Clustering

**Epic**: Basic Graph Visualization
**Priority**: P0 - Critical
**Estimate**: 1-2 days

## User Story
As a learner, I want the knowledge graph to look polished and organize related topics visually so that I can quickly understand the structure and relationships between concepts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Nodes are styled with proper colors and sizing based on difficulty (1-10 scale)
- [ ] Edges have distinct colors for different relationship types:
  - Blue (#3182bd) for prerequisites
  - Green (#31a354) for advances
  - Orange (#e6550d) for lateral connections
- [ ] Force simulation positions nodes logically:
  - Prerequisites cluster toward the left
  - Advanced topics cluster toward the right
  - Lateral connections spread vertically
- [ ] Smooth animations for all interactions (hover, click, drag)
- [ ] Visual feedback for user interactions (hover states, selection highlights)
- [ ] Graph auto-centers and fits viewport on initial load

## Technical Requirements
- Extend existing D3.js force simulation with custom positioning forces
- Implement difficulty-based node sizing (radius scales with difficulty)
- Add CSS transitions and hover effects
- Use consistent color palette from design system
- Optimize animation performance (maintain 60fps)

## Implementation Details
```javascript
// Node sizing based on difficulty
const nodeRadius = d3.scaleLinear()
  .domain([1, 10])
  .range([5, 15]);

// Custom clustering forces
.force('x', d3.forceX(node => {
  const relation = getNodeRelation(node.id);
  if (relation === 'prerequisite') return -width / 4;
  if (relation === 'advance') return width / 4;
  return 0;
}).strength(0.2))

// Edge colors
const edgeColor = d3.scaleOrdinal()
  .domain(['prerequisite', 'advance', 'lateral'])
  .range(['#3182bd', '#31a354', '#e6550d']);
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Visual design matches specified color palette
- [ ] Animations are smooth and performant
- [ ] Graph clusters logically as specified
- [ ] Node sizing correctly reflects difficulty
- [ ] Cross-browser testing passed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Mobile touch interactions work smoothly

## Testing Approach
- Manual testing with CNN.json dataset
- Visual verification of clustering behavior
- Performance testing with browser dev tools (60fps requirement)
- Color contrast testing for accessibility
- Mobile device testing for touch interactions
