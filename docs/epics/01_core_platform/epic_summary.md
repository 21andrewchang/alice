# Epic 1: Core Platform Infrastructure

**Timeline**: Week 1-2 (Alpha Phase)
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Path

## Overview
Build the foundational platform that enables users to navigate and explore a knowledge graph. This includes the basic graph visualization, node/edge data models, and core navigation features.

## Success Criteria
- Users can view and navigate a force-directed knowledge graph
- Smooth interactions (zoom, pan, drag nodes)
- Node details display on hover/click
- Graph loads from JSON data structure
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile

## User Stories Included
1. **Graph Visualization** - Display knowledge graph with D3.js force simulation
2. **Node Interactions** - Click/hover to see node details and connections  
3. **Graph Navigation** - Zoom, pan, and explore the knowledge space
4. **Data Architecture** - Establish node/edge JSON structure and loading
5. **Responsive Design** - Ensure platform works across devices

## Dependencies
- None (foundational epic)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: D3.js performance with large graphs
  - **Mitigation**: Start with smaller seed network, implement virtualization later
- **Risk**: Mobile experience poor with complex interactions
  - **Mitigation**: Touch-optimized controls, simplified mobile UI

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Force-directed graph renders with CNN.json data
- [ ] Smooth pan/zoom interactions implemented
- [ ] Node hover shows tooltip with description
- [ ] Click node shows detailed view
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout completed
- [ ] Basic performance testing passed (60fps interactions)
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
