# Story 1.1: Graph Visualization

**Epic**: Core Platform Infrastructure
**Priority**: P0 - Critical
**Estimate**: 2-3 days

## User Story
As a learner, I want to see a visual representation of knowledge topics and their relationships so that I can understand the learning landscape and navigate based on my interests.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Force-directed graph renders using D3.js
- [ ] Nodes represent learning topics with different sizes based on difficulty
- [ ] Edges show relationships (prerequisite, advance, lateral) with different colors
- [ ] Graph uses physics simulation for natural positioning
- [ ] Nodes cluster logically (prerequisites on left, advances on right, laterals scattered)
- [ ] Graph auto-fits to viewport on initial load
- [ ] Performance: Renders 50+ nodes smoothly (60fps)

## Technical Requirements
- Use existing D3.js implementation as starting point
- Implement force simulation with custom positioning:
  - Prerequisites cluster to the left
  - Advanced topics cluster to the right  
  - Lateral connections spread vertically
- Color coding for edge types:
  - Blue: prerequisite
  - Green: advance
  - Orange: lateral
- Node sizing based on difficulty (1-10 scale)

## Implementation Details
```javascript
// Force simulation configuration
const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
  .force('link', d3.forceLink(links).id(d => d.id).distance(100))
  .force('charge', d3.forceManyBody().strength(-200))
  .force('center', d3.forceCenter(0, 0))
  .force('x', d3.forceX(node => getClusterX(node)).strength(0.2))
  .force('y', d3.forceY(node => getClusterY(node)).strength(0.2))
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Graph renders with current CNN.json data
- [ ] Force simulation runs smoothly
- [ ] Visual clustering works as intended
- [ ] Edge colors match relationship types
- [ ] Node sizes reflect difficulty
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Cross-browser testing passed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Testing Approach
- Manual testing with CNN.json dataset
- Performance testing with browser dev tools
- Visual regression testing for consistent rendering
- Mobile responsiveness testing
