## MVP Alpha Task List

1. **Entry Screen**  
   - Build "What do you want to learn?" UI (text input + suggestion buttons)  
   - Wire buttons to load selected subtopic (CV or NLP)

2. **Lesson Playback Component**  
   - Embed YouTube player  
   - Display autogenerated summary below video  
   - Accept topic parameter (CV vs. NLP) to load correct lesson

3. **Branching Suggestions (Hard-coded)**  
   - Under the video, render 3–5 hard-coded next-step cards  
   - Label each as "reasonable" or "advanced jump"  
   - Clicking a card routes to its lesson (CV ↔ NLP jumps included)

4. **Wiring & Navigation**  
   - Integrate Entry → Playback → Suggestions flows  
   - Ensure topic context (CV/NLP) persists across navigation  
   - Stub in topic network data structure for later dynamic suggestions

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ **COMPLETED**
1. **Entry Screen** - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
   - ✅ "What do you want to learn?" UI with text input (`src/routes/+page.svelte`)
   - ✅ Preset topic buttons including "Machine Learning" 
   - ✅ Button wiring: ML button routes to `/ml` subtopic selection

2. **Lesson Playback Component** - FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
   - ✅ YouTube player embedded in both CV and NLP pages
   - ✅ Autogenerated summaries displayed below videos
   - ✅ Topic parameter acceptance (separate routes for `/learn/cv` and `/learn/nlp`)
   - ✅ Dynamic content loading based on timeline data structures

3. **Navigation & Layout** - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
   - ✅ Sticky header with breadcrumb navigation
   - ✅ Back button functionality to previous screens
   - ✅ Topic context preserved across navigation
   - ✅ Responsive layout with proper styling

### 🟡 **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
1. **Branching Suggestions** - MOSTLY COMPLETE
   - ✅ "Up Next" cards rendered under videos (3 cards each)
   - ✅ Difficulty indicators (1-5 dots) implemented  
   - ⚠️ **MISSING**: "reasonable" vs "advanced jump" labels
   - ✅ Cross-topic routing (CV ↔ NLP) implemented in some cards
   - ✅ Hover states and interactive styling

2. **Topic Network Data Structure** - BASIC IMPLEMENTATION
   - ✅ Hard-coded timeline arrays for both CV and NLP topics
   - ✅ Difficulty ratings and YouTube URLs structured
   - ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE**: Not properly stubbed for dynamic suggestions
   - ⚠️ **MISSING**: Cross-topic relationship mapping

### ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED (from TIMELINE.md MVP requirements)**
1. **Post-Lesson User Flow**
   - ❌ "Save your progress?" modal after video ends
   - ❌ "Continue as Guest" vs "Create Account" options
   - ❌ Account creation & OAuth integration
   - ❌ Onboarding overlay/mini-tutorial
   - ❌ Friends invitation flow

2. **Backend Integration**
   - ❌ Supabase setup for guest sessions
   - ❌ User account system
   - ❌ Progress tracking

### 🎯 **ADDITIONAL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED** (beyond V1 scope)
- ✅ Machine Learning subtopic selection page (`/[topic]` route)
- ✅ Comprehensive topic timelines (17+ topics each for CV/NLP)  
- ✅ Interactive milestone sidebar for topic switching
- ✅ Modern dark theme UI with hover effects
- ✅ Responsive design across screen sizes

### 📋 **IMMEDIATE TASKS TO COMPLETE V1**
1. Add "reasonable" vs "advanced jump" labels to suggestion cards
2. Implement post-lesson signup trigger modal  
3. Add basic guest session handling
4. Improve cross-topic relationship data structure
5. Test complete user flow from entry → subtopic → lesson → suggestions
